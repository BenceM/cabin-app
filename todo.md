make a page that lets users select between looking at cabins and selecting a date.

1. if date selection, they select the date they want and then show the available cabins for that time period

2. if cabins then show the cabin page where they can pick which cabin they'd like, similarly to now, then they can select the data and provide details, then submit

booking process:

this choice
then the available next steps based on choice
login
then pay or just pay + the details you provide without signup

also need to add dark/ light toggle could use the new css for it
need to optimize images
need to optimise data fetching (the new booking flow could help with that, because it could fetch the data while the user is still choosing the options)
